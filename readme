Algorithms and Data Structures - Assignment 4

to successfully run the code there are three steps:

make a directory "build" (mkdir build) and go there (cd build)
cmake ..
make

then you can run the code by typing ./source/algodat4

to get to the source code itself (if you are in "build")
cd ..
cd source

the following standard c++ libraries were used:
-vector
-cmath
-iostream
-cstdlib
