to successfully run the code there are three steps:

make a directory "build" (mkdir build) and go there (cd build)
cmake ..
make

then you can run the code by typing ./source/exec
the tree.gv file will also be in the "build" folder

to get to the code itself (if you are in "build")
cd ..
cd source
